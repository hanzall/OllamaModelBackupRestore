# Ollama Model Backup and Restore Documentation
## Overview

Ollama is an innovative framework designed for handling various AI models efficiently. This documentation provides detailed information about the backup and restore functionalities offered by the Ollama, including how to use these features through a Python script. 
## Features

The Ollama model backup and restore feature includes: 
- Model Listing: Display available models for user selection.
- User Selection Handling: Allow users to choose specific models for backup or restoration.
- Backup Execution: Initiate the backup process based on user selection.
- Restore Process: Facilitate restoring a previously backed up model from a specified directory.
- File Integrity Checking: Ensure the integrity of backup files using checksums.
- Error Handling: Manage errors such as no models found, invalid inputs, and file corruption.
- Colorized Output: Use color to enhance user feedback and clarity in terminal interfaces.
- User Prompts: Clear prompts for directory paths, model selections, and other inputs.
- Modular Design: Functions are organized into distinct modules for easy maintenance and extension.
     
## Usage Scenarios

This script is particularly useful for: 
- AI developers who need to manage multiple versions of models efficiently.
- Data scientists looking to archive and restore models quickly without manual intervention.
- Users requiring a robust yet user-friendly tool to handle model backups and restores in CLI environments.
     
## Installation

The script requires Python 3.x and can be run directly from the command line after installation. No additional libraries are required unless specified otherwise.

## Getting Started

To use the Ollama model backup and restore functionality, follow these steps: 
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the script repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using a terminal or command prompt by typing `python ollama_backup_restore.py`.
     
## Script Usage

The main functionalities are accessible via command-line options: 
- Backup Mode: Automatically lists available models and initiates the backup process for selected models.
- Restore Mode: Prompts user to select or input a directory containing previous backups, then lists available backups for restoration.
     
## Backup Mode

This mode allows you to back up AI models from Ollama: 
1. The script will list all available models.
2. Users can choose one or more models by entering the corresponding numbers.
3. The backup process will start based on user selection, and status updates are provided via colorized output.
     
## Restore Mode

This mode enables restoring previously backed up AI models: 
1. User is prompted to input or select a directory containing previous backups.
2. If the path is valid, the script lists all available backup files.
3. Users can choose a specific file for restoration.
4. The restore process starts with status updates via colorized output.
     
## Technical Details

- Model Listing and Selection: Uses simple text prompts to allow user interaction in choosing models or directories.
- Integrity Checking: Computes checksums (hashes) of backup files and verifies them against stored values.
- Colorized Output: Utilizes ANSI escape codes for red, green, yellow, and blue color outputs based on script notifications and statuses.
- Error Handling: Catches exceptions such as IOErrors or ValueErrors during user input and execution, providing clear error messages to guide the user.
